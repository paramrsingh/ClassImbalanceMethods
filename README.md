# Class Imbalance Methods
 This notebook illustrates a few practical methods of working with class-unbalanced data while trying to solve for a classification problem. The dataset used in this notebook is the publicly available [Titanic Survivors dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle and is used for illustrative purposes only.

The methods and techniques presented are not intended to be instructive or conclusive, but simply techniques to be considered individually or in-combination with each other, based on my learning and experience. The accompanying [blog post](https://vanishedgradient.com/2019/08/22/class-imbalance-in-datasets/) goes into narrative detail about the techniques covered.
